"# DiamondHandsProject" 

Project Description:

Multi-Approach Portfolio Optimisation Based On The Volatility Managed

The aims of the project is to demonstrate what is the best feasible optimisation based on four different approaches: the Montecarlo simulation and the Simulated Annealing

Points to develop:

Manage the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/aceofit/ stockmarketdatafrom1996to2020?select=Tickers.xlsx) to solve the problem of the NAs and store the whole dataset to the .xts format to allow the use of lists
Construct a momentum strategy based on the data
Using the different stocks for the following month investment found using the momentum strategy, we want to perform different optimisation in order to find the best performing one.
Risk parity approach
Montecarlo simulation
Markowitz Optimisation
Equally weighted
Compare the different strategies and save the results
